## Project Description

This project extends my solution from **[freeCodeCamp's Certification Project: Build a Technical Documentation Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-technical-documentation-page-project/build-a-technical-documentation-page)** by enhancing the semantic structure and improving the overall design. Unlike the original project, where I adhered strictly to the user stories and rules, this version utilizes more appropriate HTML tags, such as `article` instead of `section`, and eliminates redundant `header` tags within articles and sections.

The documentation offers a detailed explanation of HTML elements, attributes, and their usage, complete with examples and best practices.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**: A responsive navigation bar for easy access to different sections of the documentation.
- **Sections**: Various sections detailing different aspects of HTML, including introduction, head tags, text basics, lists, links, images, semantics, tables, and forms and inputs.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the page is accessible and usable on different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic elements for better accessibility and readability.
- **CSS3**: Organized and modular styling rules for a clean and responsive design.
- **Google Fonts**: Integration of modern fonts for a sleek look.
- **Flexbox**: For flexible and consistent layout across different devices.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure and content of the technical documentation page.
- `css/styles.css`: CSS file for styling the technical documentation page.

## Customization

### Changing the Theme

To customize the look and feel of the technical documentation page, you can modify the `css/styles.css` file. Here are some examples of what you can change:

- **Font & Colors**: The CSS file uses the "Mona Sans" font via Google Fonts and specifies various colors. You can change these to match your theme.
- **Layout & Spacing**: The utility classes and general styles can be adjusted to change the layout and spacing of elements.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilize flexbox or other techniques to make sure the layout adapts well to different screen sizes.
